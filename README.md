# Data-Structures-project

This project is written in C++.
The program manages the results of the University access test. 
Given a list of every student with their marks and their degree preferences, the program sorts them to fit in their preferences as long 
as there are vacancies. If not, the program tries to adjudicate them the second or third preference, up to 5.

The program writes an output file for each degree.

This project was made by 2 students:
  -Javier Ballesteros Morón (BlazeNeko)
  -Carlos Licha de la Encarnación (trjano)
